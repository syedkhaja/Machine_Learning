## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Supervised Learning: 
In this type of learning algorithm consist of a target variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Examples: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.

#### Unsupervised Learning:
In this type of learning algorithm we do not have any target variable to predict/estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention. Examples: K-means.

Here is the list of commonly used machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- kNN
- K-Means
- Random Forest
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
- Gradient Boosting algorithms(GBM, XGBoost etc.)
